Copyleft by Simone 'evilsocket' Margaritelli <evilsocket@gmail.com>

Those are the files i use for my personal website ( http://www.evilsocket.net ) with SWG ( https://github.com/evilsocket/SWG ), including swg configuration, .htaccess, images, styles
Mako templates and txt db files.

This repo is for personal use only, but feel free to learn how to use SWG and/or Mako templates with it.
