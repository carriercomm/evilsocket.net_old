I'm a sr. developer and security consultant from Italy, specialized in Unix derived systems such as GNU/Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X and on Microsoft platforms (95,98,2000,ME,XP,Vista,7,2003 Server) programming.
I developed some applications for embedded/mobile devices too, for instance iOS (iPod Touch, iPhone and iPad), Symbian OS and BlackBerry.

I have strong technical background in ethical hacking and security assessments, both for web and stand alone applications.
I've published many essays about computer security, biometrics and artificial intelligence as well as many open source projects ( i'm an open source activist ) mainly hosted on <a href="http://www.github.com/evilsocket" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
